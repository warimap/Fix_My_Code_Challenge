# Fix My Code Challenge

This repository contains several coding tasks that need to be fixed. Each task has an implementation with some issues, and your goal is to identify and fix those issues. Below, you will find a description of each task, the problem observed, and the files associated with each task.

## Task 0: FizzBuzz
### Problem
The FizzBuzz implementation in Python is not printing "FizzBuzz" when the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 (e.g., 15). It only prints "Fizz." This needs to be fixed.

### Files
- Directory: 0x00-challenge
- File: 0-fizzbuzz.py

## Task 1: Print Square
### Problem
The JavaScript implementation for printing a square is not correctly producing the expected output for larger square sizes. For example, when given a size of 10, it fails to print a square of that size.

### Files
- Directory: 0x00-challenge
- File: 1-print_square.js

## Task 2: Sort
### Problem
The Ruby implementation for sorting arguments is not correctly sorting the provided inputs. The output does not match the expected sorted order.

### Files
- Directory: 0x00-challenge
- File: 2-sort.rb

## Task 3: User Password
### Problem
The Python implementation of the User class has an issue with the `is_valid_password` method. It does not correctly validate the provided password, causing the test to fail and print an error.

### Files
- Directory: 0x00-challenge
- File: 3-user.py

## Task 4: Double Linked List
### Problem
The C implementation of a Double Linked List has issues with adding, deleting, and printing elements. The output does not match the expected behavior of a Double Linked List.

### Files
- Directory: 0x00-challenge
- File: 4-delete_dnodeint/

## Repository Information

The code for each task can be found in the GitHub repository [Fix_My_Code_Challenge](https://github.com/warimap/Fix_My_Code_Challenge). Please navigate to the respective directory and file mentioned above for each task to access the code that needs to be fixed.
